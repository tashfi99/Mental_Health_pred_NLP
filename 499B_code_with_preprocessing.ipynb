I have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence.

That and the jet lag is impairing  my functioning and I have blotchy skin and my dress is riding up on my legs and Ive had to pull it down. All I had to do today was register for the conference, but I was confused at every step and feel that everyone thinks Im stupid or hungover or unprofessional or something. Im walking around this city I do not know oblivious and feel embarrassed and stupid. My anxiety is killing me and men keep hitting on me.

My first response is always I'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where I have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or I'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nIt always turns out that whatever I did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before I knew it life is back to normal, I just wish I could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me</td>\n",

       "      <td>Am I not understanding/seeing something? This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â. Which leads me to number 4..\\n\\n4) Why any if that at all?\\n\\n\\nThe way I break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..\\n\\n4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic Ã¢â¬Åwhy are we even here?Ã¢â¬Â question. Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. Ok, for what? Like ultimately what are we even doing here? Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? Why? How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?\\n\\nSo the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.\\n\\nIm not the best at writing/typing, Im also not the best at explaining things, but I tried my best to get this off my chest.

       "1     Help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue I'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years I developed some eye floaters that I can mostly ignore. They are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but I started studying for the GRE with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how I'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how I'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school I've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.\\n\\nI really don't know how to deal here. I am not confident in exposure therapy as I have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that I don't have to deal with them. It's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be THAT much of a problem. But just now I just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now I'm dizzy with worry about it.\\n\\nWhat to do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

That by hanging around with these people I put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.\\n\\nAny thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3     My brain is driving me crazy! Im a perfectionist and think everyone hates me all the time. I literally always worried Ive done something wrong. \\n\\nIm at my first big professional conference in a major us city. I barely slept last night because of a backache and nerves. That and the jet lag is impairing  my functioning and I have blotchy skin and my dress is riding up on my legs and Ive had to pull it down. All I had to do today was register for the conference, but I was confused at every step and feel that everyone thinks Im stupid or hungover or unprofessional or something. Im walking around this city I do not know oblivious and feel embarrassed and stupid. My anxiety is killing me and men keep hitting on me. I havent been away from my husband since we moved in together and I feel so dumb and small. \\n\\nIm so scared for my presentation tomorrow. Can someone either console me or kindly put me out of my misery?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "4     Does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? Hey Reddit. Basically, I have mild anxiety. But something that really messes with my head is when I have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say I annoyed them when I did something. My first response is always I'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where I have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or I'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nIt always turns out that whatever I did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before I knew it life is back to normal, I just wish I could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "8326  Am I not understanding/seeing something? This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â. Which leads me to number 4..\\n\\n4) Why any if that at all?\\n\\n\\nThe way I break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..\\n\\n4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic Ã¢â¬Åwhy are we even here?Ã¢â¬Â question. Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. Ok, for what? Like ultimately what are we even doing here? Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? Why? How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?\\n\\nSo the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.\\n\\nIm not the best at writing/typing, Im also not the best at explaining things, but I tried my best to get this off my chest. Thanks to any that took the time to read.   \n",
       "8327  Just a bad day So today has been a stressful day, almost couldn't pay rent, found out my mother has tumors in her lungs and they might be cancerous, my significant other got extremely pissed off at me because I forgot today was our anniversary because of the other stuff that piled on, ended up breaking my phone and now being constantly told by my other half that life would be better without me in it since all I do is make them miserable. I just want to end it all but because I have kids I don't want them to live with it. I am just at a loss.\\n\\nEdit: forgot to add my spouse thinks I am cheating on them while I am just crying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8328  When Im dead maybe the suffering will all come to an end. Sorry for poor grammar. I have a plan this plan is to hang myself in my wooded area of my property. I dont feel safe not even at my school, my parents locked all of the knives away and that doesnt matter. I found a new way glass. It cuts much deeper and I bleed more. \\n      \\n        For more background information I live with my parents and two other siblings Im the youngest and am a freshmen in school. I have been sad since 6th grade and suicidal since 7th grade. Ive tried taking my life once by suffocation with an extension cord and I lived. Ever since my depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse. I now know how to kill myself and will do before Christmas. I havent set a date but the next day when I get too low my parents and siblings wont see me. When they go searching in the woods all theyÃ¢â¬â¢ll see is my body hanging from a tree.

       "8329  Fuck I've been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now.  Everything I do just makes me think about it more no matter how much I might be lying to myself about enjoying \"the moment\".  I trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone I've ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement.  My plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they don't have to deal with it but I'm leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that.  I have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence. I'm willing to hire someone to kill me at this point because I'm pretty sure I'm just too cowardly a piece of shit to do it myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â. Which leads me to number 4..\\n\\n4) Why any if that at all?\\n\\n\\nThe way I break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..\\n\\n4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic Ã¢â¬Åwhy are we even here?Ã¢â¬Â question. Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. Ok, for what? Like ultimately what are we even doing here? Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? Why? How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?\\n\\nSo the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.\\n\\nIm not the best at writing/typing, Im also not the best at explaining things, but I tried my best to get this off my chest. Thanks to any that took the time to read.</td>\n",

       "1     Help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue I'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years I developed some eye floaters that I can mostly ignore. They are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but I started studying for the GRE with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how I'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how I'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school I've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.\\n\\nI really don't know how to deal here. I am not confident in exposure therapy as I have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that I don't have to deal with them. It's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be THAT much of a problem. But just now I just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now I'm dizzy with worry about it.\\n\\nWhat to do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

That by hanging around with these people I put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.\\n\\nAny thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3     My brain is driving me crazy! Im a perfectionist and think everyone hates me all the time. I literally always worried Ive done something wrong. \\n\\nIm at my first big professional conference in a major us city. I barely slept last night because of a backache and nerves. That and the jet lag is impairing  my functioning and I have blotchy skin and my dress is riding up on my legs and Ive had to pull it down. All I had to do today was register for the conference, but I was confused at every step and feel that everyone thinks Im stupid or hungover or unprofessional or something. Im walking around this city I do not know oblivious and feel embarrassed and stupid. My anxiety is killing me and men keep hitting on me. I havent been away from my husband since we moved in together and I feel so dumb and small. \\n\\nIm so scared for my presentation tomorrow. Can someone either console me or kindly put me out of my misery?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "4     Does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? Hey Reddit. Basically, I have mild anxiety. But something that really messes with my head is when I have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say I annoyed them when I did something. My first response is always I'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where I have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or I'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nIt always turns out that whatever I did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before I knew it life is back to normal, I just wish I could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "8326  Am I not understanding/seeing something? This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â. Which leads me to number 4..\\n\\n4) Why any if that at all?\\n\\n\\nThe way I break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..\\n\\n4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic Ã¢â¬Åwhy are we even here?Ã¢â¬Â question. Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. Ok, for what? Like ultimately what are we even doing here? Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? Why? How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?\\n\\nSo the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.\\n\\nIm not the best at writing/typing, Im also not the best at explaining things, but I tried my best to get this off my chest. Thanks to any that took the time to read.   \n",
       "8327  Just a bad day So today has been a stressful day, almost couldn't pay rent, found out my mother has tumors in her lungs and they might be cancerous, my significant other got extremely pissed off at me because I forgot today was our anniversary because of the other stuff that piled on, ended up breaking my phone and now being constantly told by my other half that life would be better without me in it since all I do is make them miserable. I just want to end it all but because I have kids I don't want them to live with it. I am just at a loss.\\n\\nEdit: forgot to add my spouse thinks I am cheating on them while I am just crying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8328  When Im dead maybe the suffering will all come to an end. Sorry for poor grammar. I have a plan this plan is to hang myself in my wooded area of my property. I dont feel safe not even at my school, my parents locked all of the knives away and that doesnt matter. I found a new way glass. It cuts much deeper and I bleed more. \\n      \\n        For more background information I live with my parents and two other siblings Im the youngest and am a freshmen in school. I have been sad since 6th grade and suicidal since 7th grade. Ive tried taking my life once by suffocation with an extension cord and I lived. Ever since my depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse. I now know how to kill myself and will do before Christmas. I havent set a date but the next day when I get too low my parents and siblings wont see me. When they go searching in the woods all theyÃ¢â¬â¢ll see is my body hanging from a tree.

       "8329  Fuck I've been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now.  Everything I do just makes me think about it more no matter how much I might be lying to myself about enjoying \"the moment\".  I trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone I've ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement.  My plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they don't have to deal with it but I'm leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that.  I have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence. I'm willing to hire someone to kill me at this point because I'm pretty sure I'm just too cowardly a piece of shit to do it myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1     Help with anxietyinducing fears about school caused by a health issue Im 35 and planning to go back to grad school but over the years I developed some eye floaters that I can mostly ignore They are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels but I started studying for the GRE with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now and theyve left me with anxiety about how Im going to cope with school if on top of everything else like how Im no longer used to student life how grad school is likely the hardest form of school Ive ever done etc add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me    I really dont know how to deal here I am not confident in exposure therapy as I have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that I dont have to deal with them Its not a big issue and some junk in my eyes shouldnt be THAT much of a problem But just now I just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now Im dizzy with worry about it    What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "8326  Am I not understandingseeing something This is not a cry for help this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion    What Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to eventsobservations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way     Anyway I genuinely just dont see the point of this life To me it seems very high painlowmediocre reward     In just about every situation there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with That being    1 The necessary hardshipslessons you endure in life    2 The reward you get out of it    3 Was the reward even worth it    4 Why any of it at all    Number 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue    1 A young kid gets hisher heart crushed in high school by a girlboy maybe more than once    2 Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner    3 This may happen a few more times into adulthood but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with Cool but of course no matter what issues still occur and recurr with any relationship    4 Why any of this at all    A different example    1 Guy grows up in poverty    2 All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had    3 He finally has a big house nice car and things hes always wanted And in my mind Im like   Ok I just went through absolute hell to have these things what nowÃ¢â¬Â Which leads me to number 4    4 Why any if that at all      The way I break down these experiences in my little 14 format may be flawed 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap but anyway    4 is the main one for me its just kind of the classic   why are we even hereÃ¢â¬Â question Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness Ok for what Like ultimately what are we even doing here Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on Why How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all    So the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place makes me not want to live anymore    Im not the best at writingtyping Im also not the best at explaining things but I tried my best to get this off my chest Thanks to any that took the time to read  \n",

       "      <td>Am I not understanding/seeing something? This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â. Which leads me to number 4..\\n\\n4) Why any if that at all?\\n\\n\\nThe way I break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..\\n\\n4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic Ã¢â¬Åwhy are we even here?Ã¢â¬Â question. Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. Ok, for what? Like ultimately what are we even doing here? Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? Why? How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?\\n\\nSo the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.\\n\\nIm not the best at writing/typing, Im also not the best at explaining things, but I tried my best to get this off my chest.

       "1     Help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue I'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years I developed some eye floaters that I can mostly ignore. They are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but I started studying for the GRE with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how I'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how I'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school I've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.\\n\\nI really don't know how to deal here. I am not confident in exposure therapy as I have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that I don't have to deal with them. It's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be THAT much of a problem. But just now I just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now I'm dizzy with worry about it.\\n\\nWhat to do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

That by hanging around with these people I put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.\\n\\nAny thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3     My brain is driving me crazy! Im a perfectionist and think everyone hates me all the time. I literally always worried Ive done something wrong. \\n\\nIm at my first big professional conference in a major us city. I barely slept last night because of a backache and nerves. That and the jet lag is impairing  my functioning and I have blotchy skin and my dress is riding up on my legs and Ive had to pull it down. All I had to do today was register for the conference, but I was confused at every step and feel that everyone thinks Im stupid or hungover or unprofessional or something. Im walking around this city I do not know oblivious and feel embarrassed and stupid. My anxiety is killing me and men keep hitting on me. I havent been away from my husband since we moved in together and I feel so dumb and small. \\n\\nIm so scared for my presentation tomorrow. Can someone either console me or kindly put me out of my misery?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "4     Does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? Hey Reddit. Basically, I have mild anxiety. But something that really messes with my head is when I have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say I annoyed them when I did something. My first response is always I'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where I have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or I'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nIt always turns out that whatever I did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before I knew it life is back to normal, I just wish I could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "8326  Am I not understanding/seeing something? This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â. Which leads me to number 4..\\n\\n4) Why any if that at all?\\n\\n\\nThe way I break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..\\n\\n4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic Ã¢â¬Åwhy are we even here?Ã¢â¬Â question. Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. Ok, for what? Like ultimately what are we even doing here? Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? Why? How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?\\n\\nSo the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.\\n\\nIm not the best at writing/typing, Im also not the best at explaining things, but I tried my best to get this off my chest. Thanks to any that took the time to read.   \n",
       "8327  Just a bad day So today has been a stressful day, almost couldn't pay rent, found out my mother has tumors in her lungs and they might be cancerous, my significant other got extremely pissed off at me because I forgot today was our anniversary because of the other stuff that piled on, ended up breaking my phone and now being constantly told by my other half that life would be better without me in it since all I do is make them miserable. I just want to end it all but because I have kids I don't want them to live with it. I am just at a loss.\\n\\nEdit: forgot to add my spouse thinks I am cheating on them while I am just crying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8328  When Im dead maybe the suffering will all come to an end. Sorry for poor grammar. I have a plan this plan is to hang myself in my wooded area of my property. I dont feel safe not even at my school, my parents locked all of the knives away and that doesnt matter. I found a new way glass. It cuts much deeper and I bleed more. \\n      \\n        For more background information I live with my parents and two other siblings Im the youngest and am a freshmen in school. I have been sad since 6th grade and suicidal since 7th grade. Ive tried taking my life once by suffocation with an extension cord and I lived. Ever since my depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse. I now know how to kill myself and will do before Christmas. I havent set a date but the next day when I get too low my parents and siblings wont see me. When they go searching in the woods all theyÃ¢â¬â¢ll see is my body hanging from a tree.

       "8329  Fuck I've been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now.  Everything I do just makes me think about it more no matter how much I might be lying to myself about enjoying \"the moment\".  I trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone I've ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement.  My plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they don't have to deal with it but I'm leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that.  I have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence. I'm willing to hire someone to kill me at this point because I'm pretty sure I'm just too cowardly a piece of shit to do it myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1     Help with anxietyinducing fears about school caused by a health issue Im 35 and planning to go back to grad school but over the years I developed some eye floaters that I can mostly ignore They are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels but I started studying for the GRE with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now and theyve left me with anxiety about how Im going to cope with school if on top of everything else like how Im no longer used to student life how grad school is likely the hardest form of school Ive ever done etc add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me    I really dont know how to deal here I am not confident in exposure therapy as I have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that I dont have to deal with them Its not a big issue and some junk in my eyes shouldnt be THAT much of a problem But just now I just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now Im dizzy with worry about it    What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "8326  Am I not understandingseeing something This is not a cry for help this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion    What Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to eventsobservations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way     Anyway I genuinely just dont see the point of this life To me it seems very high painlowmediocre reward     In just about every situation there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with That being    1 The necessary hardshipslessons you endure in life    2 The reward you get out of it    3 Was the reward even worth it    4 Why any of it at all    Number 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue    1 A young kid gets hisher heart crushed in high school by a girlboy maybe more than once    2 Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner    3 This may happen a few more times into adulthood but theyre finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with Cool but of course no matter what issues still occur and recurr with any relationship    4 Why any of this at all    A different example    1 Guy grows up in poverty    2 All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had    3 He finally has a big house nice car and things hes always wanted And in my mind Im like   Ok I just went through absolute hell to have these things what now Which leads me to number 4    4 Why any if that at all      The way I break down these experiences in my little 14 format may be flawed 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap but anyway    4 is the main one for me its just kind of the classic   why are we even here question Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness Ok for what Like ultimately what are we even doing here Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on Why How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all    So the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place makes me not want to live anymore    Im not the best at writingtyping Im also not the best at explaining things but I tried my best to get this off my chest Thanks to any that took the time to read  \n",

       "'0 does anyone else get anxious with working im scared that im going to have to do repairs that cost of money\\n1 help with anxietyinducing fears about school caused by a health issue im 35 and planning to go back to grad school but over the years i developed some eye floaters that i can mostly ignore they are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels but i started studying for the gre with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now and theyve left me with anxiety about how im going to cope with school if on top of everything else like how im no longer used to student life how grad school is likely the hardest form of school ive ever done etc add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me i really dont know how to deal here i am not confident in exposure therapy as i have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that i dont have to deal with them its not a big issue and some junk in my eyes shouldnt be that much of a problem but just now i just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now im dizzy with worry about it what to do\\n2 use up whats left and throw the rest away i recently returned from 6 years working overseas unfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health im doing fine now as far as that is concerned attended therapy clean and sober since november last year when i came back i heard a few of my friends use the following phrase well just use up whats left of him and then throw the rest away ive never heard this before ive always been a people pleasing personality type and im struggling hard to determine how to interpret it maybe i just dont want to face facts that it means exactly what it says that by hanging around with these people i put myself in a weak position and they arent real friends at all any thoughts\\n3 my brain is driving me crazy im a perfectionist and think everyone hates me all the time i literally always worried ive done something wrong im at my first big professional conference in a major us city i barely slept last night because of a backache and nerves that and the jet lag is impairing my functioning and i have blotchy skin and my dress is riding up on my legs and ive had to pull it down all i had to do today was register for the conference but i was confused at every step and feel that everyone thinks im stupid or hungover or unprofessional or something im walking around this city i do not know oblivious and feel embarrassed and stupid my anxiety is killing me and men keep hitting on me i havent been away from my husband since we moved in together and i feel so dumb and small im so scared for my presentation tomorrow can someone either console me or kindly put me out of my misery\\n4 does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend hey reddit basically i have mild anxiety but something that really messes with my head is when i have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say i annoyed them when i did something my first response is always im sorry and trying not to say it a million times over but my mind then goes through this turmoil where i have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of theyll hate me forever now or im such a horrible person as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person it always turns out that whatever i did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before i knew it life is back to normal i just wish i could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me\\n...\\n8325 alone useless and horribly guilty reaching out here because i have nothing else no friends or family or anything no money or hobbies or interests or a career or a future not healthy in body or in the mind ive been trying harder than i have ever tried and cant do it\\n8326 am i not understandingseeing something this is not a cry for help this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion what im about to say is coming from a point of view that im aware may be negative and skewed due to eventsobservations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way anyway i genuinely just dont see the point of this life to me it seems very high painlowmediocre reward in just about every situation there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have goals you have and just life in general that i have a problem with that being 1 the necessary hardshipslessons you endure in life 2 the reward you get out of it 3 was the reward even worth it 4 why any of it at all number 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion but still contributes to why i have suicidal thoughts i think the 4 above points apply to literally everything but ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue 1 a young kid gets hisher heart crushed in high school by a girlboy maybe more than once 2 kid gains a new understanding of what love really is or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner 3 this may happen a few more times into adulthood but theyre finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with cool but of course no matter what issues still occur and recurr with any relationship 4 why any of this at all a different example 1 guy grows up in poverty 2 all of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had 3 he finally has a big house nice car and things hes always wanted and in my mind im like ok i just went through absolute hell to have these things what now which leads me to number 4 4 why any if that at all the way i break down these experiences in my little 14 format may be flawed 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap but anyway 4 is the main one for me its just kind of the classic why are we even here question ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness ok for what like ultimately what are we even doing here are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on why how does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all so the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place makes me not want to live anymore im not the best at writingtyping im also not the best at explaining things but i tried my best to get this off my chest thanks to any that took the time to read\\n8327 just a bad day so today has been a stressful day almost couldnt pay rent found out my mother has tumors in her lungs and they might be cancerous my significant other got extremely pissed off at me because i forgot today was our anniversary because of the other stuff that piled on ended up breaking my phone and now being constantly told by my other half that life would be better without me in it since all i do is make them miserable i just want to end it all but because i have kids i dont want them to live with it i am just at a loss edit forgot to add my spouse thinks i am cheating on them while i am just crying\\n8328 when im dead maybe the suffering will all come to an end sorry for poor grammar i have a plan this plan is to hang myself in my wooded area of my property i dont feel safe not even at my school my parents locked all of the knives away and that doesnt matter i found a new way glass it cuts much deeper and i bleed more for more background information i live with my parents and two other siblings im the youngest and am a freshmen in school i have been sad since 6th grade and suicidal since 7th grade ive tried taking my life once by suffocation with an extension cord and i lived ever since my depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse i now know how to kill myself and will do before christmas i havent set a date but the next day when i get too low my parents and siblings wont see me when they go searching in the woods all theyll see is my body hanging from a tree im sorry im too late to fix and im sorry\\n8329 fuck ive been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now everything i do just makes me think about it more no matter how much i might be lying to myself about enjoying the moment i trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone ive ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement my plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they dont have to deal with it but im leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that i have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence im willing to hire someone to kill me at this

This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â.

       "1     Help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue I'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years I developed some eye floaters that I can mostly ignore. They are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but I started studying for the GRE with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how I'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how I'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school I've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.\\n\\nI really don't know how to deal here. I am not confident in exposure therapy as I have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that I don't have to deal with them. It's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be THAT much of a problem. But just now I just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now I'm dizzy with worry about it.\\n\\nWhat to do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

That by hanging around with these people I put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.\\n\\nAny thoughts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3     My brain is driving me crazy! Im a perfectionist and think everyone hates me all the time. I literally always worried Ive done something wrong. \\n\\nIm at my first big professional conference in a major us city. I barely slept last night because of a backache and nerves. That and the jet lag is impairing  my functioning and I have blotchy skin and my dress is riding up on my legs and Ive had to pull it down. All I had to do today was register for the conference, but I was confused at every step and feel that everyone thinks Im stupid or hungover or unprofessional or something. Im walking around this city I do not know oblivious and feel embarrassed and stupid. My anxiety is killing me and men keep hitting on me. I havent been away from my husband since we moved in together and I feel so dumb and small. \\n\\nIm so scared for my presentation tomorrow. Can someone either console me or kindly put me out of my misery?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "4     Does anyone else feel like the worst person ever if they annoy a friend? Hey Reddit. Basically, I have mild anxiety. But something that really messes with my head is when I have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say I annoyed them when I did something. My first response is always I'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where I have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or I'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nIt always turns out that whatever I did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before I knew it life is back to normal, I just wish I could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "8326  Am I not understanding/seeing something? This is not a cry for help, this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy, Id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion.\\n\\nWhat Im about to say is coming from a point of view that Im aware may be negative and skewed due to events/observations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way. \\n\\nAnyway, I genuinely just dont see the point of this life. To me, it seems very high pain-low/mediocre reward. \\n\\nIn just about every situation, there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have, goals you have and just life in general that I have a problem with. That being:\\n\\n1) The necessary hard-ships/lessons you endure in life.\\n\\n2) The reward you get out of it.\\n\\n3) Was the reward even worth it?\\n\\n4) Why any of it at all?\\n\\nNumber 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion, but still contributes to why I have suicidal thoughts. I think the 4 above points apply to literally everything, but Ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue.\\n\\n1) A young kid gets his/her heart crushed in high school by a girl/boy. (maybe more than once)\\n\\n2) Kid gains a new understanding of what love really is, or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner.\\n\\n3) This may happen a few more times into adulthood, but theyÃ¢â¬â¢re finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with. Cool, but of course no matter what, issues still occur, and recurr with any relationship.\\n\\n4) Why any of this at all?\\n\\nA different example:\\n\\n1) Guy grows up in poverty\\n\\n2) All of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had.\\n\\n3) He finally has a big house, nice car, and things hes always wanted. And in my mind, Im like Ã¢â¬ÅOk.. I just went through absolute hell to have these things.. what now?Ã¢â¬Â. Which leads me to number 4..\\n\\n4) Why any if that at all?\\n\\n\\nThe way I break down these experiences in my little 1-4 format may be flawed, 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap, but anyway..\\n\\n4 is the main one for me, its just kind of the classic Ã¢â¬Åwhy are we even here?Ã¢â¬Â question. Ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness. Ok, for what? Like ultimately what are we even doing here? Are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on? Why? How does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all?\\n\\nSo the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness, and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place, makes me not want to live anymore.\\n\\nIm not the best at writing/typing, Im also not the best at explaining things, but I tried my best to get this off my chest. Thanks to any that took the time to read.   \n",
       "8327  Just a bad day So today has been a stressful day, almost couldn't pay rent, found out my mother has tumors in her lungs and they might be cancerous, my significant other got extremely pissed off at me because I forgot today was our anniversary because of the other stuff that piled on, ended up breaking my phone and now being constantly told by my other half that life would be better without me in it since all I do is make them miserable. I just want to end it all but because I have kids I don't want them to live with it. I am just at a loss.\\n\\nEdit: forgot to add my spouse thinks I am cheating on them while I am just crying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "8328  When Im dead maybe the suffering will all come to an end. Sorry for poor grammar. I have a plan this plan is to hang myself in my wooded area of my property. I dont feel safe not even at my school, my parents locked all of the knives away and that doesnt matter. I found a new way glass. It cuts much deeper and I bleed more. \\n      \\n        For more background information I live with my parents and two other siblings Im the youngest and am a freshmen in school. I have been sad since 6th grade and suicidal since 7th grade. Ive tried taking my life once by suffocation with an extension cord and I lived. Ever since my depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse. I now know how to kill myself and will do before Christmas. I havent set a date but the next day when I get too low my parents and siblings wont see me. When they go searching in the woods all theyÃ¢â¬â¢ll see is my body hanging from a tree.

       "8329  Fuck I've been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now.  Everything I do just makes me think about it more no matter how much I might be lying to myself about enjoying \"the moment\".  I trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone I've ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement.  My plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they don't have to deal with it but I'm leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that.  I have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence. I'm willing to hire someone to kill me at this point because I'm pretty sure I'm just too cowardly a piece of shit to do it myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "8326  am i not understandingseeing something this is not a cry for help this is not me asking for prayers and sympathy id like this to be more of an intellectual discussion    what im about to say is coming from a point of view that im aware may be negative and skewed due to eventsobservations that conditioned my subconscious to think this way     anyway i genuinely just dont see the point of this life to me it seems very high painlowmediocre reward     in just about every situation there are 4 things that usually happen with experiences you have goals you have and just life in general that i have a problem with that being    1 the necessary hardshipslessons you endure in life    2 the reward you get out of it    3 was the reward even worth it    4 why any of it at all    number 4 falls into more if a philosophical discussion but still contributes to why i have suicidal thoughts i think the 4 above points apply to literally everything but ill throw out a couple of examples in the format of those points to help illustrate my issue    1 a young kid gets hisher heart crushed in high school by a girlboy maybe more than once    2 kid gains a new understanding of what love really is or at least what it isnt and maybe gains a better idea of what they want in a partner    3 this may happen a few more times into adulthood but theyre finally at a point where they may have found someone they choose to settle with cool but of course no matter what issues still occur and recurr with any relationship    4 why any of this at all    a different example    1 guy grows up in poverty    2 all of those years in poverty gave him this crazy drive to make tons of money and live a life he never had    3 he finally has a big house nice car and things hes always wanted and in my mind im like   ok i just went through absolute hell to have these things what now which leads me to number 4    4 why any if that at all      the way i break down these experiences in my little 14 format may be flawed 3 and 4 to me are related and can overlap but anyway    4 is the main one for me its just kind of the classic   why are we even here question ok so you learn these lessons in life and eventually find happiness ok for what like ultimately what are we even doing here are we here just to experience things in these little fleshy suits we have on why how does what we experience in our lives here tie into any signifigance into anything at all    so the combination of the sometimes unbearable pain it takes to finally experience happiness and not seeing the point of any of it in the first place makes me not want to live anymore    im not the best at writingtyping im also not the best at explaining things but i tried my best to get this off my chest thanks to any that took the time to read  \n",

My first response is always I'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where I have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or I'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nIt always turns out that whatever I did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before I knew it life is back to normal, I just wish I could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "1  Help with anxiety-inducing fears about school caused by a health issue I'm 35 and planning to go back to grad school, but over the years I developed some eye floaters that I can mostly ignore. They are just out of my visible sight range when reading small books like novels, but I started studying for the GRE with a big textbook and realized how obvious these floaters were now, and they've left me with anxiety about how I'm going to cope with school if, on top of everything else like how I'm no longer used to student life, how grad school is likely the hardest form of school I've ever done etc, add to that this problem with distracting floaters in my eyes that distract and annoy me.\\n\\nI really don't know how to deal here. I am not confident in exposure therapy as I have had these floaters for a few years and really only learned to deal with them by changing my lifestyle such that I don't have to deal with them. It's not a big issue, and some junk in my eyes shouldn't be THAT much of a problem. But just now I just glanced at my book for a few minutes and now I'm dizzy with worry about it.\\n\\nWhat to do?   \n",
       "2  Use up what's left and throw the rest away I recently returned from 6 years working overseas.\\n\\nUnfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health.\\n\\nI'm doing fine now as far as that is concerned. Attended therapy, clean and sober since November last year.\\n\\nWhen I came back I heard a few of my \"friends\" use the following phrase,\\n\\n\"we'll just use up what's left of him and then throw the rest away\"\\n\\nI've never heard this before. I've always been a people pleasing personality type and I'm struggling hard to determine how to interpret it.\\n\\nMaybe I just don't want to face facts that it means exactly what it says...

I literally always worried Ive done something wrong. \\n\\nIm at my first big professional conference in a major us city. I barely slept last night because of a backache and nerves. That and the jet lag is impairing  my functioning and I have blotchy skin and my dress is riding up on my legs and Ive had to pull it down. All I had to do today was register for the conference, but I was confused at every step and feel that everyone thinks Im stupid or hungover or unprofessional or something. Im walking around this city I do not know oblivious and feel embarrassed and stupid. My anxiety is killing me and men keep hitting on me. I havent been away from my husband since we moved in together and I feel so dumb and small. \\n\\nIm so scared for my presentation tomorrow.

But something that really messes with my head is when I have a fall out or get a blunt text from a friend to say I annoyed them when I did something. My first response is always I'm sorry (and trying not to say it a million times over) but my mind then goes through this turmoil where I have all these esteem lowering thoughts along the lines of, they'll hate me forever now, or I'm such a horrible person, as well as being filled with guilt for upsetting the person.\\nIt always turns out that whatever I did wrong only annoyed them for a short period of time and before I knew it life is back to normal, I just wish I could control the horrible negative wave that comes over me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
